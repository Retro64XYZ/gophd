gophd - A simple Gopher server
=


After years of programming with all sorts of scripting languages​​, especially in the area of ​​web development, I decided to dive into C and become a real programmer :-). My first few hours with C were exhausting but have paid off. The result is this little gopher server. It is full of bugs and probably has a few memory leaks, but I think we'll manage.

Feel free to join here. A more extensive documentation will follow.

In the /example folder you'll find a little Gophermap example. Place that file in your GOPHER_ROOT directory or in any folder below that to display your custom Gopher menu instead of just the directory.
